# Congressional Districts by Congress #

This repo demonstrates GitHub's geojson diff features.

Take a look at each object's history to view maps of each congressional district over time.

There are also separate branches for each state, which makes it easier to load diffs without crashing your browser.

All of this fun with git was generated in R. See code files in the master branch.
